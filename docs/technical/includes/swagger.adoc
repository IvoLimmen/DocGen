## Swagger

When scanning for Swagger documents the software will look for any JSON and YML file and assume it is a Swagger file to convert.

### What does the JSON/YML Swagger to AsciiDoc converter, convert?

The following models from OpenAPI are being converted to AsciiDoc:

* Info
** Title
** Description
** Version
** Contact information
  
* Paths (sorted!)
** Per path the operations if they are present in the following order:
*** delete
*** get
*** head
*** options
*** patch
*** post
*** put
*** trace
* Per operation:
** the current path
** the call (method and path)
** If the method is deprecated (warning)
** Description
** Summary
** RequestBody
*** Description
*** If the body is required
*** Shows object references per media type
** Parameters
*** Lists type, name, description, schema and default
*** Also adds examples in the default column
** Responses
*** Shows object references per media type
*** Currently does not list anonymous types
** Security

* Securityschemes

* Security if it is globally defined

The following stuff is not (yet?) handled:

  * External examples
  * Headers
  * Servers
  * Tags

Note: When reading the description of the swagger file it will also convert the markdown links and convert them to asciidoc macro links.
