## Maven-Analyser

Simply gets all the dependencies from a `pom.xml` by looking at the `DependencyManagement` group.
If you use maven correctly you should have all the dependencies listed there with the version that is used.
The tool does check and resolve properties if your version is a property.

The tool writes a JSON from the analysed data for the DocGen application to use and generate an overview of connected applications.
