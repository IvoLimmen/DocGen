## What does the JSON/YML Swagger to AsciiDoc converter, convert?

The following models from OpenAPI are being converted to AsciiDoc:

* Info
** Title
** Description
** Version
** Contact information
  
* Paths (sorted!)
** Per path the operations if they are present in the following order:
*** delete
*** get
*** head
*** options
*** patch
*** post
*** put
*** trace
* Per operation:
** the current path
** the call (method and path)
** If the method is deprecated (warning)
** Description
** Summary
** RequestBody
*** Description
*** If the body is required
*** Shows object references per media type
** Parameters
*** Lists type, name, description, schema and default
*** Also adds examples in the default column
** Responses

*** Currently does not list anonymous types

The following stuff is not (yet?) handled:

  * External examples
