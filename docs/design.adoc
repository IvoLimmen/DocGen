# Design document

## Goal of this application

Will convert as much as possible to generate one documentation hub from a set of input files.

The input should be a configuration file that contains a input directory and a set of rules so it 
knows how to generate the index.

It should be your central point for all documentation in an organisation. All companies have the 
abillity to standardize; something that can not be done in the wild internet.

So this tool centralizes and standardizes. It standardizes on the use of AsciiDoc for all the 
manually written documentation. Swagger version 3 for all REST endpoints.

## Requirements / limitations

### Directory structure 

Use a maximum of 3 directories deep, mainly used in this form:

* Team directory

** Product directory

*** Extra directory (for grouping purposes)

Files can be places everywhere, so you do not need to go 3 deep but 3 deep is the maximum that is 
generated in the index.

### Files that use imports

Because the software will convert every `adoc` file it can find it is better to use a different file 
extention for included files; otherwise the includes will show up in the index.
