# Design document

## Goal of this application

Will convert as much as possible to generate one documentation hub from a set of input files.

The input should be a configuration file that contains a input directory and a set of rules so it 
knows how to generate the index.

## Requirements / limitations

### Directory structure 

Use a maximum of 3 directories deep, mainly used in this form:

* Team directory

** Product directory

*** Extra directory (for grouping purposes)

Files can be places everywhere, so you do not need to go 3 deep but 3 deep is the maximum that is 
generated in the index.

### Files that use imports

Because the software will convert every `adoc` file it can find it is better to use a different file 
extention for included files; otherwise the includes will show up in the index.
