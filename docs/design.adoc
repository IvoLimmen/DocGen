# Design document

## Goal of this application

Takes a directory containing multiple AsciiDoc files and generates a nice index on top of it. But it should be as flexible as possible. So documents sould be easibly renamed just as directories.

The input should be a configuration file that contains a input directory and a set of rules so it knows how to generate the index.
