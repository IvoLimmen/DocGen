# Maven-Analyser

This is a very simple tool that reads the dependecies of a project and creates a simple JSON file to be used to generate more documentation and graphs.

## Goal

To analyse the existing pom.xml for external dependencies that contain the company name we are analysing for.
The result is added to the project.json file that is shared with the DocGen application.
